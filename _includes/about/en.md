## Project Experience

#### Proposed a Mapping to Divide Given Points into Group (06/2018)
* Constructed artificial neural network and applied deep leaning to cluster any points in $\mathbb{R^2}$ into two categories.
* Minimized cost by *stochastic gradient*; trained this network by MATLAB.
* Cost underwent a flood period towards the start of process; After this plateau, the cost decayed at a very slow linear rate. When extra data point was added, mapping still performed well.

#### Parameter Estimation of Finite Normal Mixture Samples (05/2018)
* Used *EM algorithm* to estimate unknown parameters of finite normal mixture through R.
* Result showed less than 5% relative errors compared with real data; Though the number of iterations was kind of big, but the cost of iteration is relatively low.

#### Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient through MATLAB (11/2016)
* Considered a method to *precondition* n-by-n symmetric positive definite linear system $Ax=b$ so that the matrix of coefficient assumed well conditioned or had just a few distinct eigenvalues.
* Based on *Incomplete Cholesky Factorization* and other transformation to *precondition* $A$; Applied *Conjugated gradient* to transformed system and get the method called *Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient*. 

## Internship Experience

#### China Logistic Information Index Co., Ltd, Manager Assistant (08/2018-09/2018)
* Participated in PMI investigation and assisted in distributing over 700 questionnaire surveys. 
* Gathered survey results and calculated related PMI indexes; adjusted the data in accordance with the season; calculated the correlation coefficient among PMI indexes using R. 
* Compared the calculated indexes with official data released by National Bureau of Statistics to validate the results; created index variation diagram and analyzed the index fluctuation reasons.

#### China Logistic Information Center, Assistant (09/2018-10/2018)
- Gathered the logistics information report from each department and calculated the China Highway Freight & Logistics Weekly Index; created index variation diagram. 
- Analyzed the fluctuation of the weekly indexes and wrote a corresponding report, which got published on the official website of China Logistic Information Center. 
- Assisted in completing China Logistic Enterprise Business Environment Report. 
- Participated in significant meetings such as *Transportation, Energy and Yangtze River Economic Belt Situation Analysis Session*.
