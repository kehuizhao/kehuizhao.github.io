## Project Experience

#### Deep Learning Through MATLAB (06/2018)

* Proposed a mapping to divide the given points into groups; produced output and generalized cost function by target output. 

* Minimized the cost function using stochastic gradient method; computed gradients by back propagation. 

* Results showed that with the increase of iterations, output became gradually closer to the target output; the 

mapping performed well with testing data 

#### Parameter Estimation of Finite Normal Mixture Samples (05/2018)

- Introduced latent variable into the research; based on Bayes Principle, applied EM algorithm to logarithmic likelihood function and got the iterative formula with unknown parameter. 
- Selected the appropriate initial value to minimize iteration times using R; compared the final result with the original set value. 
- Results showed that EM algorithm was effective in estimating unknown parameter; the low cost of iteration offset the disadvantage of EM algorithm in demanding great iterations to converge. 

#### Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient through MATLAB (11/2016)

- Raised a method to optimize Conjugated Gradient 

- Converted n√ón symmetric positive equations Ax = b into new equations; applied Conjugated Gradient and incomplete Cholesky factorization to obtain Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient. 

- Pre-conditioned matrix A could accelerate function convergence with fewer relative errors. 

## Internship Experience

#### China Logistic Information Index Co., Ltd, Manager Assistant (08/2018-09/2018)

* Participated in PMI investigation and assisted in distributing over 700 questionnaire surveys. 
* Gathered survey results and calculated related PMI indexes; adjusted the data in accordance with the season; calculated the correlation coefficient among PMI indexes using R. 
* Compared the calculated indexes with official data released by National Bureau of Statistics to validate the results; created index variation diagram and analyzed the index fluctuation reasons. 

#### China Logistic Information Center, Assistant (09/2018-10/2018)

- Gathered the logistics information report from each department and calculated the China Highway Freight & Logistics Weekly Index; created index variation diagram. 
- Analyzed the fluctuation of the weekly indexes and wrote a corresponding report, which got published on the official website of China Logistic Information Center. 
- Assisted in completing China Logistic Enterprise Business Environment Report. 
- Participated in significant meetings such as Transportation, Energy and Yangtze River Economic Belt Situation Analysis Session.
