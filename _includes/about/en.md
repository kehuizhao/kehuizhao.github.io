## Project Experience

#### Proposed a Mapping to Divide Given Points into Group (06/2018)                              

* Considered *labeled data* in $\mathbb{R^2}$ : some are in category *A*, the rest are in category *B*. Aimed to construct a transformation that took any points in  $\mathbb{R^2}$ to return either category *A* or *B*.
* Constructed such transformation based on artificial neural network.
* Use MATLAB to train this network: initialize all weight and biases using randn and set a constant learning rate; use the iteration summarized above and store the value of cost function as each iteration; use the semiology command to visualize the process of iteration.
* **semiology** Plot shows cost undergoes a flood period towards the start of process; After this plateau, the cost decayed at a very slow linear rate. When extra data point is added, after repeating this process, the other points almost remain in the same groups as before.

#### Parameter Estimation of Finite Normal Mixture Samples (05/2018)

* Aimed to use *EM algorithm* to estimate unknown parameters of finite normal mixture like: $f(x\|\theta)=\sum^k_{i=1}P_if_i(x)$, where $P_i > 0$, $\sum^k_{i=1}P_i=1$ and $f_i(x)$ is the density of $N(\mu_i,\sigma^2)$; here $(P, \mu, \sigma^2)$ is parameter that needs estimation.
* By introducing latent variable $z$, applied *EM algorithm* to get iteration of unknown parameters.
* Based on data that chose from random finite normal mixture, got the estimation of unknown parameter by R. 
* Estimation mentioned above showed less than 5% relative errors compared with real data; Though the number of iterations was kind of big, about 1500~3000 times, the cost of iteration is relatively low and running time is less than a minute.
#### Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient through MATLAB (11/2016)
* Considered a method to *precondition* n-by-n symmetric positive definite linear system $Ax=b$ so that the matrix of coefficient assumed well conditioned or had just a few distinct eigenvalues.
* Transformed the system above into $\mathbf{A}\tilde{x}=\tilde{b}$, where $\mathbf{A}=C^{-1}AC^{-1}$, $\tilde{x}=Cx$ , $\tilde{b}=C^{-1}b$, $C$ was a symmetric positive definite; tried to choose proper $C$ by an *Incomplete Cholesky Factorization* of $A$.
* Applied *Conjugated gradient* to transformed system and get the method called *Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient*.
* Tested this algorithm by MATLAB: Produce a random positive definite linear system $Ax=b$ through MATLAB; Based on the same number of iterations, used MATLAB to compare the running time and relative error before *preconditioned* with those after *preconditioned*.
* The result from *Preconditioned Conjugated Gradient* shows 28% ~60% fewer relative errors than that from *Conjugated Gradient*, depending on the order of $A​$ and the number of iterations.
